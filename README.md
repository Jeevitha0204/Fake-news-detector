# üì∞ Fake News Detection Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project focuses on detecting **Fake News** using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. It takes in a news article and classifies it as either **Real** or **Fake**.

## üöÄ Project Overview

With the exponential growth of online content, the spread of misinformation (fake news) has become a major issue. This project aims to solve that problem using machine learning, text preprocessing, and NLP methods. The solution is trained on real-world data and can predict the authenticity of a news article.

## üéØ Objective

- Classify news content as **Real** or **Fake**.
- Use **NLP preprocessing** to clean and transform text.
- Apply **machine learning models** like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest.
- Create a **Gradio interface** for easy interaction.
- Deploy the model on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
